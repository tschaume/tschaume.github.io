tschaume.github.io
==================

Idea:

pushing short commit messages to the jekyll _data folder via a post-receive hook from all my git repositories spread over https://github.com/tschaume, http://gitlab.the-huck.com and http://cgit.the-huck.com
=> Generate a feed and possibly some interesting git stats
